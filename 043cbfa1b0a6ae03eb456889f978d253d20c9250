      "message": "Actually, I originally only adapted this plugin to 3.2 (we will skip 3.1 for our own Gerrit installations) and it worked fine. The change you mentioned [1] was submitted to master. Will it be downported to stable-3.2 or only be available for 3.3 in a few weeks? Since it is still available (and will probably stay at least in 3.2), I would prefer not to duplicate the code earlier than we have to.\nNevertheless, thanks for the hint! I will keep an eye on this util method.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/258921",
