Per default the scope of the\n`@RequiresCapability` annotation is `CapabilityScope.CONTEXT`, that means:\n\n* when `@RequiresCapability` is used within a plugin the scope of the capability is assumed to be that plugin.\n\n* If `@RequiresCapability` is used within the core Gerrit Code Review server (and thus is outside of a plugin) the scope is the core server and will use\nthe `GlobalCapability` known to Gerrit Code Review server.\n\nIf a plugin needs to use a core capability name (e.g. \"administrateServer\")\nthis can be specified by setting `scope \u003d CapabilityScope.CORE`:",
