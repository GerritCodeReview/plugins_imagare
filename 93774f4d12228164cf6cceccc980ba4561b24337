Why would you want to update the dependency?\nAlso without adding the updated dependencies in the bazel build, I would guess that the build would fail. (Zuul is currently failing the builds due to an infrastructure issue).\nFurther, please note that the imagare plugin is deprecated. There won\u0027t be any support anymore. It still kind of works for Gerrit 2.16 and 3.2 with reduced functionality, but not in newer versions.",

Am I missing something?\n\n\u003e Also without adding the updated dependencies in the bazel build, I would guess that the build would fail.\n\nYou\u0027re right.

      "message": "apache commons v3 was only added as a dependency of another dependency [1]. If you use `git grep org.apache.commons.lang3`you won\u0027t find any occurrence. However, I have seen you change introducing that now.\n\nI verified that this change works with Gerrit 3.2 branch (only if I cherry pick it to stable-3.2 of this plugin. The master branch is out of date). So please rebase it.\n\nI can\u0027t give you CR+2 since this plugin is not supported anymore and I am thus not a maintainer anymore.
